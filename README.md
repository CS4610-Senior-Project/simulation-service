# Simulation Service
This project offers a service for running simulations in Amesim from the command line. The idea is that students design an Amesim model once and run many experiments on it without having to use the Amesim software. There are two ways to use the service:

 1. Run from config file ([example](/examples/plane_config.json)) -- recommended 
 2. Call library methods directly ([example](/examples/plane_example.py))

See project paper for more info.

## Usage

-   Login to CPP [Virtual Engineering Lab 2](https://www.cpp.edu/it/virtual-software-lab/index.shtml) to get access to Amesim

-   Create a model circuit in Amesim 

-   Save the model by generating a python script file in Amesim
  
    `File -> Generate Model Script -> Python`

-   Create a config.json file
 
-   Set `$AME` environment variable to location of Amesim package

    `set AME=C:\\Program Files\\Simcenter\\2310\\Amesim`
     
-   Go to simulation_service directory

    `cd simulation_service`
    
-   Run simulation service

    `â€œC:\\Program Files\\Simcenter\\2310\\Amesim\\python.bat" simulation_service.py`
    - Note: We must run with the python distribution included with Amesim. CPP's virtual lab doesn't allow us to modify the Python path variable directly.
